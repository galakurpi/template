- 3 REASONING PARAGRAPHS
Start by writing 3 reasoning paragraphs about it , DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. Quiet the ego. Constantly question your assumptions. Start each paragraph with saying "wait..." and then continue with the reasoning.
After reasoning, study the code to see where you should change it and apply the changes you reasoned about.

- UNCERTAINTY -> REASONING
do ... you should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty, and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.

# WHAT DO I DO
tell me what test I should run to do ... give me step by step instructions

- REASONER INPUT
chat -> Ask o3 -> copy response -> composer: I asked an expert...


- OBJECTIVE 50/50
BEFORE YOU ANSWER, i want you to write two detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solutions - do not jump to conclusions, seriously consider both approaches

then, after you finish, tell me whether one of these solutions is obviously better than the other, and why.


- MAKE PERPLEXITY SEARCH QUERY
let's perform a web search. your task is to write a one-paragraph search query, as if you were telling a human researcher that to find, including all the relevant context. format the paragraph as clear instructions, commanding a researcher to find what we're looking for. ask for code snippets or technical details when relevant


- SEARCH RESULT ANALYSIS
... give me the tl;dr of the search results. Be careful, often the search results contain dangerous and distracting red herrings.


- CONTEXT SUMMARY
before we proceed, i need you to give me a summary of the current state of the project.

format this as 3 concise paragraphs, where you describe what we just did, what did not work, which files were updated/created, what mistakes to avoid, any key insights/lessons we've learned, what problems/errors we are facing, ... and anything else a programmer might need to work productively on this project.

write in a conversational yet informative tone,
something like a README file on github that is super information dense and without any fluff or noise. DO NOT include any assumptions or theories, just the facts.

i expect to see three concise paragraphs, written as if you were giving instructions to another programmer and this was ALL you could tell him.

- UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
Now, based on the new changes you've added, please update the instructions from ...

Make the new instructions have the same format as the old instructions. Same information showing.
IMPORTANT: Make the new instructions have the same length as the old instructions. It has to be similar.
